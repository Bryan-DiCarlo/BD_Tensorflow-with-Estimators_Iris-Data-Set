# BD_Tensorflow-with-Estimators_Iris-Data-Set
Here we use Tensorflow with estimators to predict the species of flower from the IRIS data set. The IRIS data set is a data set containing
four measurements from three different species of the iris flower. The four measurements wre taken from 50 different flowers in each of 
the three different species. We will use Tensorflow with estimators to train a model and then predict the species of flower from the 
training data. This model performed pretty well with only two misclassifications in the test set.  Roughly 96% correct calls in the test
set.
